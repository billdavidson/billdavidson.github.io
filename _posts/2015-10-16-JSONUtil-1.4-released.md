JSONUtil 1.4 has been released.  Get it [here](/JSONUtil/)

This release adds support for full customization of date string formats for both generation and parsing.

I have abandoned the attempt to make JSONConfig thread safe. It broke data structure loop detection through JSONAble's and the only way to fix it would be to change the JSONAble interface, which I don't want to do. It's complex enough as it is. Do not share JSONConfig objects between threads. They will break.
