JSONUtil 1.7.1 has been released.  Get it [here](/JSONUtil/)

This release fixes a minor bug in the IndentPadding that sometimes caused the wrong indent level.

For those that are interested in the source, there has been more code reorganization.  appendRecursivePropertyValue() had grown too large and its code has been broken up into other methods and some of it in other classes.

If you're using Java 7 or earlier, download the jars with your Java version number. Otherwise just get the regular jars that don't have a Java version in their name. They require a minimum of Java 8.

The binaries are also available at the [Maven Central Repository](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.kopitubruk.util%22%20AND%20a%3A%22JSONUtil%22)
