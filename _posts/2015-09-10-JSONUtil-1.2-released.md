JSONUtil 1.2 has been released.  Read about it [here](/JSONUtil/)

This release adds the JSONParser class which will parse JSON data.

It converts Javascript objects to LinkedHashMap's with the property names being the keys.

It converts Javascript arrays to ArrayList's.

It is more permissive in the data that it accepts than the JSON standard. It allows Javascript
strings with either type of quote. It allows unquoted identifiers. It allows full
Javascript numbers. It also allows ECMAScript 6 style code point escapes.
