JSONUtil 1.10.4 has been released.  Get it [here](/JSONUtil/)

The main change in this release is that the default for undefined code points is now JSONConfig.PASS.  I was confused by a document that was primarily concerned with display.  This package isn't really doing display so replace isn't really an appropriate default.  Unmatched surrogates remain as default to be replaced.  Replace is still available as an option.  It just isn't the default anymore.

There is also a small optimization for the toJSON methods that return a string.  It probably won't matter unless you use those a lot and have a lot of strings that need escaping.

If you're using Java 7 or earlier, download the jars with your Java version number. Otherwise just get the regular jars that don't have a Java version in their name. They require a minimum of Java 8.

The binaries are also available at the [Maven Central Repository](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.kopitubruk.util%22%20AND%20a%3A%22JSONUtil%22)
