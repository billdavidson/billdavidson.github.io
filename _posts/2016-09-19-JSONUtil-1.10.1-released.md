JSONUtil 1.10.1 has been released.  Get it [here](/JSONUtil/)

1.10.0 improved performance for string values that did not contain code points that needed to be escaped.  This release improves performance for strings that do need escaping.  If your strings need a lot of escaping then it dramatically improves performance.

JSONUtil now provides a boolean property name validator if you want to validate property names.

JsonObject has been enhanced to take a reference to a JSONConfig object which can be passed to the constructor or to a setter.  When its toString or toJSON methods that don't take a JSONConfig as a parameter are called, it will use that as its configuration object.  If you pass a null config to the other ones, it will also use the one it has stored.

All of the public methods in JSONConfig which had a void return type now return the JSONConfig object itself. This is so that you can call such methods in series as with JsonObject.add().

If you're using Java 7 or earlier, download the jars with your Java version number. Otherwise just get the regular jars that don't have a Java version in their name. They require a minimum of Java 8.

The binaries are also available at the [Maven Central Repository](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.kopitubruk.util%22%20AND%20a%3A%22JSONUtil%22)
