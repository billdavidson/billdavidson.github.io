JSONUtil 1.9.3 has been released.  Get it [here](/JSONUtil/)

This release is primarily driven by optimizations to the reflection code. Both cached and uncached reflection performance has been significantly improved. Reflection performance is now quite good.

If you're using Java 7 or earlier, download the jars with your Java version number. Otherwise just get the regular jars that don't have a Java version in their name. They require a minimum of Java 8.

The binaries are also available at the [Maven Central Repository](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.kopitubruk.util%22%20AND%20a%3A%22JSONUtil%22)
